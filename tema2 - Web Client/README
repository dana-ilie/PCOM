# About
I have used the HTTP laboratory as a refference to implement this assignment.

# Implementation

The client implemented in the "client.c" file interprets commands from the user
, interacts with the server based on these commands and displays the server's
response until the user enters the "exit" command.

## While loop

In the while loop, the command is read from the user and the corresponding
action is performed.

### Register
If the command is "register", it is checked if the user is already logged in, as
the user can only register if he is not logged in. If the user is not logged
in, the function "register_user" is called in order to make the registration.
In the "register_user" function, the user is asked for an username and
password, which are then validated, as to not contain spaces.
If the username and password are valid, a post request is sent to the server
in order to register the user. If the response from the server contains an
error, the error is extracted from the response and displayed to the user.

### Login
If the command is "login", it is checked if the user is already logged in, as
the user can only login if he is not logged in. If the user is not logged in,
the function "login_user" is called in order to make the login. In the
"login_user" function, the user is asked for an username and password, then a
post request is sent to the server in order to login the user. If the response
from the server contains an error, the error is extracted from the response
and displayed to the user.
If the response doesn't contain an error, the cookie is extracted from the
response and returned.

### Enter_library
If the command is "enter_library", it is checked if the user is logged in, as
the user can only request access to the library if he is logged in. If the user
is logged in and hasn't already entered the library, the function
"enter_library" is called in order to make the request. In the "enter_library"
function, a get request is sent to the server in order to request access to the
library. If the response from the server contains an error, the error is
extracted from the response and displayed to the user.
If the response doesn't contain an error, the JWT token is extracted from the
response and returned. The JWT token is then used to prove the access to the
library.

### Get_books
If the command is "get_books", it is checked if the user is logged in, as
the user can only request the books if he is logged in. If the user is logged
in and has access to the library(previously entered the library), the function
"get_books" is called in order to make the request. In the "get_books" function,
a get request is sent to the server in order to request the books. If the
response from the server contains an error, the error is extracted from the
response and displayed to the user.
If the response doesn't contain an error, the books are extracted from the
response and displayed to the user.

### Get_book
If the command is "get_book", an id is read from the user and validated. If the
id is valid, it is checked if the user is logged in, as the user can only
request the book if he is logged in. If the user is logged in and has access to
the library(previously entered the library), the function "get_book" is called.
In the "get_book" function, a get request is sent to the server in order to
get the book. If the response from the server contains an error, the error is
extracted from the response and displayed to the user.
If the response doesn't contain an error, the book is extracted from the
response and displayed to the user.

### Add_book
If the command is "add_book", it is checked if the user is logged in, as
the user can only add a book if he is logged in. If the user is logged in and
has access to the library(previously entered the library), the function
"add_book" is called in order to make the request. In the "add_book" function,
a title, an author, a genre, a number of pages and a publisher are read from
the user and validated. Then a post request is sent to the server in order to
add the book.
If the response from the server contains an error, the error is extracted from
the response and displayed to the user.

### Delete_book
If the command is "delete_book", an id is read from the user and validated.
If the id is valid, it is checked if the user is logged in, as the user can only
delete a book if he is logged in. If the user is logged in and has access to the
library(previously entered the library), the function "delete_book" is called.
In the "delete_book" function, a delete request is sent to the server in order
to delete the book. If the response from the server contains an error, the
error is extracted from the response and displayed to the user.

### Logout
If the command is "logout", it is checked if the user is logged in, as the user
can only logout if he is logged in. If the user is logged in, the function
"logout_user" is called in order to make the logout. In the "logout_user"
function, a get request is sent to the server in order to logout the user.
If the response from the server contains an error, the error is extracted from
the response and displayed to the user.

### Exit
If the command is "exit", the while loop is terminated.
